Project team

Assign a project team with employees from sales, customer service, accounting, purchasing, operations and senior management. Each team member should be
committed to the success of the project and accountable for specific tasks, i.e. developing a timeline, finalizing objectives, formulating a training plan. Make sure you include first line
workers as well as management on your team. Base the selection on the knowledge of the team not status of the employee.
